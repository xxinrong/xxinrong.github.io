	<h1>What is the metaverse?</h1>
	
	<p class="p-color">
		The Metaverse is a shared, decentralized, and digital space that exists beyond the real world. It can be experienced through virtual reality (VR) or augmented reality (AR). It's a place where people can exist in digital forms, similar to how we already exist as physical beings in our own world. We are able to design the environment of the metaverse by ourselves, so it will be unique to each person who visits it.
    </p>
	
	<p class="p-color">The concept of the metaverse was first introduced in Neal Stephenson's 1992 novel “Snow Crash”. In it, he described what his vision for what could become of our current technology if we keep improving upon it: an immersive space where users could literally "walk" through different areas and interact with other users from anywhere on Earth--or even beyond! Since then, it has become a recurrent theme in science fiction as well as in the digital world.

	<h3>Does the metaverse already exist in the game?</h3>
	
	<p>To some extent, metaverse already exists in the game. But it is immature.Some of the social elements of the metaverse are already present in video games. Take Fortnite, for example, an online shooter that can be played on computers, consoles and mobile devices. The average Fortnite player uses a personal avatar and spends hundreds of hours in the game, fighting and interacting with other players' avatars. Players can also customize their avatars by accumulating virtual currency to unlock equipment and other props.
	</p>

    <p>The predecessor to the metaverse can also be found in Second Life, an online social platform developed by Linden Lab nearly 20 years ago where people create their own digital representations and socialize with others. In this virtual space, users can shop, build property and enrich their virtual lives. Virtual reality technology has also evolved in video games. in 2016, Sony released the PlayStation VR, a virtual reality headset that can be hooked up to the PlayStation 4 console to play virtual reality games, for $400.

    <p>But these are just steppingstones to a full metaverse, which is still in the process of being formed. Thanks to fast Internet connections, powerful virtual reality headsets and a plethora of gamers, people are now more likely to live in a richly animated, lifelike 3D simulation, say technology experts.

	<h3>Impact of the metaverse</h3>

    <p>The metaverse will affect the way we think, work, live, communicate and travel. It will also change the way we buy things. For example, since the metaverse is a virtual reality world where you can create your own avatar and interact with others in a digital world, it could have an impact on how you think about yourself. Your sense of identity may be influenced by this new environment in which you find yourself immersed. You might take on different characteristics depending on whether you're playing games or working or socializing within this digital space.
	</p>

    <p>As people become more accustomed to interacting with each other virtually (in addition to face-to-face interactions), they may find it easier to relate to others who don't look like them or share their cultural background simply because they share experiences through virtual reality that cross national boundaries and cultures easily.
